[mcn](https://gitlab.com/cxss/mcn) but better in every way.

here's laundry list of things i want:

* go cli interface using charm.sh via rust ffi
* gateway node in ts with prisma & graphql
* edge nodes in rust using rpi pico

inversion of control for commanding devices

instead of thinking of devices as something unique & announcable (e.g. hello network i'm `some_device_v23.1`) with its own pre-defined schema of outputs (e.g. light controller), devices are dumb endpoints that can parse a schema and perform some action as a result - that way you don't need to re-write some C code, flash the device & whatever to get new functionality

```
              cli (rust/go) 
               |
               v
 prisma <--> gateway (typescript)
               |
            rabbitmq
           /   |    \
          v    |     v
      device   v    device (rust/c)
            device
```
