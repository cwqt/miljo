inversion of control for commanding devices

instead of thinking of devices as something unique & announcable (e.g. hello network i'm `some_device_v23.1`) with its own pre-defined schema of outputs (e.g. light controller), devices are dumb endpoints that can parse a schema and perform some action as a result - that way you don't need to re-write some C code, flash the device & whatever to get new functionality
